# Stock-Market-Analysis
# Stock Price Prediction 

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock market data and building a predictive model to understand stock price trends. The objective is to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and apply machine learning techniques to predict stock prices based on historical patterns.

## Dataset
- Historical stock price data
- Features include Open, High, Low, Close prices and Volume
- Time-series based financial dataset

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Key Steps Performed
- Data loading and inspection
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of stock trends and price movements
- Feature preparation for model building
- Stock price prediction using machine learning techniques
- Model evaluation and result analysis

## Visualizations
- Stock price trend analysis
- Volume vs price movement plots
- Comparative visual insights for better interpretation

## Outcome
- Identified meaningful trends and patterns in stock price movements
- Built a predictive approach to estimate future stock prices
- Gained practical experience in financial data analysis and time-series handling

## Learning Takeaways
- Hands-on experience with real-world financial datasets
